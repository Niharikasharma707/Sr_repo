Automated Repository Sync Script
This Python script automates the synchronization of changes between different users' Git repositories. It facilitates collaboration by ensuring that updates from one user's repository can be easily integrated into others' repositories while maintaining a clear log of changes.

Key Features
User-Specific Repositories:

The script supports multiple users, each with their own repositories.
It automatically detects and tracks changes across repositories.
Commit-Based Syncing:

Changes are synced between repositories based on commit messages.
The script generates detailed patch files containing the commit message, commit ID, repository name, and differences in code.
Change Tracking:

Users can log and check which repository is ahead or behind in terms of commits.
Commit headers provide a transparent view of the synchronization status.
Conflict-Free Integration:

Ensures smooth syncing by applying patch files with automated handling of updates.
Custom Patch File Format:

Patch files include structured metadata such as:
Commit Message: Title summarizing the changes.
Commit ID: Unique identifier for the changes.
Repository Name: Source of the changes.
These patches can serve as a reference for merging changes manually if needed.
Workflow
Commit Changes:

A user commits changes to their repository.
Generate Patch:

The script detects new commits and generates a patch file with all relevant details.
Sync Repositories:

The patch file is applied to other users' repositories, ensuring all users stay updated with the latest changes.
Log Updates:

Users can view the sync log to determine the current status of their repository in relation to others.
